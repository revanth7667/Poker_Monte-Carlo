# Monte Carlo Simulation using Python to Predict Winning Hand
This project uses Python to perform a Monte Carlo simulation to calcuate the probability of each hand winning a game of Poker.

This project was done as a part of the [MIDS](https://datascience.duke.edu/) Bootcamp facilitated by [Andrew Hilton](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/andrew-hilton) and [Genevieve Lipp](https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/genevieve-lipp)  

**Note**: Additional Details and instructions will be added in the future

## Contents:
### 1. Python Files
The ``codes`` directory contains the following python files:
1. card - defines the "Card" class
2. deck - defines the "Deck" class
3. future - defines the FutureCards class
4. pinput - reads the hands from a text file and create the FutureCards Deck
5. evaluate - ompares 2 poker Hands and decide the winning hand 
6. poker - performs a monte-carlo simulation to calcuate the odds of each hand winning the 
poker game
7. execute - To Call poker.py with default arguments for users who don't want to use command line



### 2. Test File
The ``poker_test.txt`` contains 3 sample hands for testing the monte-carlo simulation. The 

**Note**: To ensure proper testing, the third hand is designed in such a way that it is not expected to win any games.
